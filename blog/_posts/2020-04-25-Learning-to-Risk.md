### Introduction

Real-world datasets are heavily unbalanced in terms of samples per class. Much of the mass is assigned to the tail and many classical asymptotic results are not applicable. Variational approximations with priors in the exponential family are not well suited for such scenario, focusing on centered distributions. To counteract this problem, handcrafted re-sampling and data augmentation techniques are typically employed.
