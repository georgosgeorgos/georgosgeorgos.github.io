> We extend the framework of variational autoencoders to represent transformations explicitly in the latent space. In the family of hierarchical graphical models that emerges, the latent space is populated by higher order objects that are inferred jointly with the latent representations they act on. To explicitly demonstrate the effect of these higher order objects, we show that the inferred latent transformations reflect interpretable properties in the observation space.
